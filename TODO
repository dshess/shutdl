Have a setup command, something like:

--init --dir="${DIR}" --url="${URL}"

This could figure out the right url and remember it, so you don't have to
specify it every time.  It could also include the login process.

site.shutterfly.com is home, .header-tab-selected contains an href to the
current URL, and the text "Home"

From Home, "Pictures & Videos" goes to site.shutterfly.com/pictures.
.header-tab-selected contains an href to the current URL, and the text "Pictures
& Videos".

From "Pictures & Videos", clicking "Pictures" takes you to:
   https://site.shutterfly.com/pictures/5
which lists the first 25 albums.  I don't know if "5" is always the same value.
